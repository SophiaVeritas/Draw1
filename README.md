# Draw1
Uses C# and GDI+ for testing possible use in future CAD programs. (SCREEN SHOTS PROVIDED) 

This was a rainy day project where the goal was to only spend an hour or two. This is a good refrence for some one just learning. It provides a chance to see drawing simple primatives, lines, circles, color changes, brushes, linear gradients, writing strings, simple collision detection of points and lines. 

Notes: This program is complete. It was never intended to be bug free, or function well, it was a simple demonstation test, and in that regard it achives it goal. I post this as a simple refrence for those who would like a crude working example, so they can better plan the program(s) they are writing. Enjoy.
